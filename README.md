# Census-analysis
Our objective is to analyze the data of the US Census Bureau for migration patterns within the state of Texas. 
We plan to find the most and least popular locations. We will also examine the employment rate to determine if there are positive or negative correlations.

Proposal Questions: 
1) What area had the largest amount of growth?
2) What area had the largest decrease in population?
3) Is there a strong correlation between employment rate and population?
