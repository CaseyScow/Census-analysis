# Census-analysis
Our objective is to analyze the data of the US census bureau for migration patterns within the US. 
We plan to find the most popular and least popular locations. Our analysis will also show pre-covid and
post-covid migration and how it may or may not have changed where people are going. Finally, we plan
to look at the cost of living and determine if there are positive or negative correlations.
