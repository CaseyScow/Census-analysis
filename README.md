# Census-analysis

Our objective is to analyze the data of the US Census Bureau for migration patterns within the state of Texas. 
We plan to find the most and least popular locations. We will also examine the employment rate to determine if there are positive or negative correlations.

Proposal Questions: 
1) What area had the largest amount of growth?
2) What area had the largest decrease in population?
3) Is there a strong correlation between employment rate and population?

Analysis:

The information our team reviewed came from the US Census Bureauâ€™s 2022 data. We looked at the population change within the state of TX as well as employment change to understand if there was a correlation between the two. Finally, we broke up our data by zip code and compared them to each other by percentages. 

We were able to identify the top 25 zip codes that had the largest growth. When comparing them side-by-side, our bar graph identified one outlier in the data, zip code 76519 within Burlington, TX. This zip code had an increase of 93.2%. Upon closer examination, we realized it only had a small population living within it, and in comparison to the other top zip codes, it had fewer people moving there. The small change in population made a large change when looked at as a percentage. The remaining 24 areas all had increases in the 8%- 9% range. We then created a geo plot of the top zip codes to identify any trends for where people are going. Our map showed the zip codes ranging from all corners of the state. Some were in major cities and others were in the rural areas. While most of them were spread out across the state, we saw that Dallas was the only area that held multiple of them. The greater Dallas area held 4 of the top 25 zip codes, and while that is more than any other city, we cannot say Dallas is the most popular area people are moving to because of the various locations of the rest.

We then identified the bottom 25 zip codes of all of TX. When compared side-by-side in a bar graph, we noticed they were much more identical than the top 25. They all had a decrease in population but by minor amounts. The ranges varied between -0.2%- 0%. Although there are decreases in population, we believe they were so small because they still may have had new residences moving there. When looked at in a geo plot, we noticed again that the 25 zip codes ranged all over Texas with the greater Dallas area holding the most. Although Dallas held the most again, it was only a few (7) of the 25 zip codes. Based on our data, we believe that people are moving to all areas of the state and not just the major cities. 

Finally, we compared the population changes to the employment rate for each zip code to determine if there was any correlation. To do this we plotted a regression line on a scatter plot that compares population change to employment change for 2022 for each zip code. We found that there was a positive correlation of 0.75. Our data showed that as more people move to the area, the more people are working. We assume that the amount of population growth in the area drives up the cost of living, causing more people who normally would not be working to seek employment. 

In conclusion, the population growth in the top zip codes outweighs the population decreases in the bottom, meaning more people are coming to Texas than leaving. This is also driving up the number of people working. As the population grows, the percentage of people who are employed in each zip code is also increasing.
